We are looking to hire a Founding Software Engineer / Developer to build our human verification marketplace and help
Distributed Apps secure their smart contracts. We are a small team with broad experience in tech startups who want to
build products that realise the potential of blockchain.

We are looking for someone with considerable experience as a developer who now feels like they can take the role of 
tech lead and build a product from scratch. The role is fully remote although we need you to be in timezones UTC-0 to 
UTC-2 for easier collaboration during the day. Currently, we work 5 days a week but we are open to the idea of part-time
(pro-rata), if that's what you're looking for.

You must have experience with JavaScript, React, Typescript, Docker, and blockchain knowledge is definitely a plus. The 
salary is negotiable upon experience but we're talking in the range of 50k - 80k EUR per year plus stock options. This 
is a great chance to bring your creativity to the early stages of a company and be involved in a revolutionary industry.

If this sounds of interest, or if you have any questions, please get in touch via the button below with a CV and short 
introduction. We're looking forward to hearing from you!
