Prosopo is designing the future of smart contract security. We are a small team with broad experience in tech startups who want to help realise the potential of blockchain. We are looking for a software developer with 3+ years experience to help bring our product from prototype to a commercial success.

You must have experience with JavaScript, React, Typescript, Docker, and blockchain knowledge is definitely a plus. The salary is negotiable upon experience.

The role is fully remote although we need you to be in timezones UTC-0 to UTC-2 for easier collaboration during the day. Currently, we work 5 days a week with flexible hours.

This is a great chance to bring your creativity to the early stages of a company and be involved in a revolutionary industry.

If this sounds of interest, or if you have any questions, please get in touch!
