                    <p>
                        We're delighted to announce that Prosopo recently received funding from the <a href="https://web3.foundation/">Web3 Foundation</a> that
                        will help to build our decentralised human verification marketplace. We've designed a protocol
                        that will give Distributed Apps the power to secure their user traffic and prevent bot attacks,
                        whilst retaining a high level of decentralisation. Services like Prosopo are the key to moving
                        blockchain applications from the fringes of society to every day parts of our lives.
                    </p>
                    <h2><span class="tickwhite">✭</span> Milestone 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        The initial development began in October 2021 with
                        the <a href="https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/">Protocol</a> smart contract, which will
                        govern the marketplace economics. The contract is written in <code>ink!</code> due to its type
                        safe
                        and memory safe capabilities that are automatically inherited from Rust. <code>ink!</code> can
                        also be
                        compiled to WASM, a fast and efficient language created for the web. This increases the
                        interoperability of contracts written in <code>ink!</code> as they can be deployed in any WASM
                        Virtual
                        Machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have also created a prototype of the Prosopo
                        <a href="https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider">provider</a> node, which will form the
                        network and perform the task of verifying users of Distributed Apps as being human or
                        not. This node is designed to send solved and unsolved CAPTCHAs to the users of Distributed
                        Apps so that they can verify themselves as being human. The Providers then update the Protocol
                        smart contract, creating a queryable reputation based on the user's AccountId which the
                        Distributed Application can use to confirm the user's humanesss via a cross-contract call. This
                        process is highlighted below.

                    <h2><span class="tickwhite">✭</span> Lessons So Far</h2>
                    <p>
                        The learning curve to adapt to <a
                            href="https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/"><code>ink!</code></a> was quite steep coming
                        from the world of python
                        and
                        other garbage collected languages. However, we quickly realised the Rust compiler is your friend
                        and following its tips will lead to successful code compilation. <code>ink!</code> is actually a
                        subset of
                        Rust so there are less things to worry about than if you were jumping straight into coding Rust
                        projects for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>no-std</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most important things to highlight to <code>ink!</code> newbies is the
                        <code>no-std</code> environment in Rust.
                        This forces <code>ink!</code> to only load crates that are platform agnostic, meaning that
                        simple tasks,
                        such as printing variables, cannot necessarily be performed. Instead, contract development in
                        ink!
                        relies on specific ink environment functions such as <code>ink_env::debug_println!("{}", "your
                        string here")</code>. Luckily, the <a
                            href="https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/master/examples/erc20/lib.rs">example
                        contracts</a>
                        demonstrate plenty of these useful functions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Contract functionality has been tested utilising the <code>ink!</code> unit testing engine and
                        the
                        experimental test engine. The basic engine supports calling functions but lacks the ability to
                        set a transferred token value or set the caller, which are both key parts of many of the Prosopo
                        Protocol functions. Working with this combination, we've managed to cover >90% of the functions
                        in our contract with tests, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tarpaulin+rust&t=brave&ia=web">tarpaulin</a>
                        being used to calculate the coverage metrics.

                    <h3>Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ink!</code> and Polkadot community is very helpful and responsive to questions
                        surrounding development. Releases come frequent and fast but there are helpful notes that
                        accompany them. You can usually find some guidance or a solution by chatting to the developers
                        in their <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#ink:matrix.parity.io">matrix server</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2><span class="tickwhite">✭</span> What's next?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We now have a basic backend marketplace to which verification Providers and Distributed apps can
                        register but we're some way off deploying to any of the Polkadot parachains. Our roadmap for
                        Milestone 2 of the Web3 Foundation grant and the future MVP is highlighted below:

                    </p>
                    <h4>Milestone 2</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a CAPTCHA frontend that can be embedded in a Distributed Application</li>
                        <li>Create a demo website showing how users can embed the CAPTCHA challenge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>MVP</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Migrate the contract to <a

                        <li>Work out a long term solution for contract upgradeability</li>
                        <li>Perform load testing of the Provider node</li>
                        <li>Introduce the economic governance system into the contract</li>
                        <li>Partner with Polkadot parachains to help prevent bots</li>
                        <li>+ many more!!!</li>
